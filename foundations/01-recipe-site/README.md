# Recipe Project

**Description:**
A dynamic recipe website built during my Foundations course. This project allowed me to dive deeper into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by creating a visually appealing, user-friendly platform for showcasing recipes.

**Features:**

- Responsive design using CSS Flexbox and media queries
- Elegant layout focused on readability and aesthetics
- Interactive elements like hover effects and smooth transitions to enhance user experience
