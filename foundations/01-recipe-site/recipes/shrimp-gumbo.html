        <h1>Shrimp Gumbo</h1>
        <p>This is and adaptation of a recipe my sister in law gave me. It is hearty and delicious. You can make it as spicy or as mild as you like to your taste and it doesn't take long to make. Set out hot sauce for diners to season to their own liking.</p>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1</strong><br>Heat oil in a large stockpot over medium-high heat. Add onion, bell pepper, and jalapeno and saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2</strong><br>Drain liquid from tomatoes into the stockpot. Place tomatoes on a cutting board, dice, and add to the pot. Add chicken broth, rice mix, and seasoning packet, cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until rice is tender, about 25 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3</strong><br>Add sliced sausage and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in shrimp, and cook until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, about 3 minutes more.</li>

        <h2>Cook's Notes:</h2>
        <p>Omit jalapenos and use mild sausage to lower heat level.</p>
        <p>Water can be used instead of chicken broth, and you can use smoked sausage instead of fully cooked Italian sausage.</p>
